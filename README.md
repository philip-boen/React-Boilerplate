# React + Vite Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate code for building React applications using Vite, a fast build tool for modern web development. This boilerplate code provides a starting point for building a React application with Vite, with pre-configured settings for development and production environments.

### The boilerplate code includes the following features:
+ React 18
+ Vite 4.3.2
+ ESLint and Prettier pre-configured
+ Support for TypeScript
+ Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for fast development
+ Production-ready build configuration
+ Basic folder structure for organizing your code

To get started with this boilerplate code, simply clone the repository and run **`npm install`** to install the dependencies. You can then run **`npm run dev`** to start the development server, and **`npm run build`** to build the production-ready code.

Feel free to customize this boilerplate code to fit your specific needs and requirements for your React application. Happy coding!
